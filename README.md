# Zig Practice
This repo is a place to store some projects as I practice Zig

## Projects
### 1. Hello World
- **Overview:** Start with the classic "Hello, World!" program to get acquainted with the syntax and basic structure of a Zig program.
- **Skills to focus on:** Syntax, basic program structure, printing output.
- **Additional considerations:** None.

### 2. Simple Calculator
- **Overview:** Build a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **Skills to focus on:** Input handling, basic control flow (if-else), arithmetic operations.
- **Additional considerations:** Error handling for division by zero.

### 3. File I/O
- **Overview:** Create a program that reads data from a text file, performs some operations on it, and writes the result back to another file.
- **Skills to focus on:** File I/O operations, error handling, string manipulation.
- **Additional considerations:** Handling different file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).

### 4. Web Server
- **Overview:** Implement a basic HTTP server that can serve static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and handle simple GET requests.
- **Skills to focus on:** Networking, concurrency (handling multiple requests), error handling.
- **Additional considerations:** Security best practices (e.g., input validation, preventing common vulnerabilities).

### 5. Data Structures: Linked List
- **Overview:** Implement a linked list data structure along with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Skills to focus on:** Data structure design, memory management, pointer manipulation.
- **Additional considerations:** Generic programming to make the linked list reusable for different data types.

### 6. Sorting Algorithms
- **Overview:** Implement common sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort) and compare their performance.
- **Skills to focus on:** Algorithm design, performance analysis, benchmarking.
- **Additional considerations:** Optimizing algorithms for efficiency and understanding trade-offs.

### 7. Game of Life
- **Overview:** Implement Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton simulation, using Zig. Visualize the game state using a simple graphical interface.
- **Skills to focus on:** Simulation logic, graphical output, user interaction.
- **Additional considerations:** Optimizing performance for large grids, exploring different grid representations.

### 8. Simple Interpreter
- **Overview:** Build a basic interpreter for a simple programming language (e.g., a subset of Python or Lisp).
- **Skills to focus on:** Parsing, interpreting, abstract syntax trees (AST), basic language design.
- **Additional considerations:** Error handling, supporting control flow and data types.

### 9. Concurrent Programming: Producer-Consumer Problem
- **Overview:** Solve the classic producer-consumer problem using Zig's concurrency primitives (e.g., fibers, async/await).
- **Skills to focus on:** Concurrent programming, synchronization, deadlock prevention.
- **Additional considerations:** Performance optimization, handling edge cases (e.g., producer or consumer termination).

### 10. Embedded Systems: LED Matrix Display
- **Overview:** Interface with a simple LED matrix display (e.g., 8x8) using Zig to create basic animations or display text messages.
- **Skills to focus on:** Hardware interaction, low-level programming, real-time constraints.
- **Additional considerations:** Optimizing code for resource-constrained environments, understanding hardware specifications.
